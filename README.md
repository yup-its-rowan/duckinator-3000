# duckinator-3000

GUI-based Java program that creates copy and pastable FTC-compliant Android Studio code.

Basically the long story long is that this program allows you to drop dots on a virtual field.
Those points draw a path thats translated into Java code that you can copy and paste into your programs.
A runnable .jar file is available in the /dist folder, so if you want just the program download and run only that .jar file.

Make sure to configure your motors and have fun!

Love,
